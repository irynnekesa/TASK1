        <p>My name is Nekesa Irene,a Medical Reseacher</p>
        <p>I was born 0n 1st Jan 2000. I went to Kawempe Decororous for my  Nursery and Primary Education from 2003 to 2011.</p>
         <p>In 2012, I joined Mbogo Mixed mixed Secondary Schoolf for my Highschool up tp 2016 when i completed my A level.Mbogo mixed is a muslim Founded School and so besides Knowledge, I got more exposed to religion of Islam</p>
            <p>Iam a Medical Researcher in Tuberculosis and HIV Cases and iam very passionate about the evaluation of TB patients and by evaluation i mean from the time a patient visists the clinic to seek care up to the time the patient leaves the facility after being intiated on treatment by the healthworkers</p>
            <p>In August 2018, I started on my diploma.During that time, i got so exposed to clinical work and trials </p>
            <p>Evaluation is a long term process the fact that it involves trurn arounds and by that i mean patient going through screening, a number of tests and getting medication</p>
            <p>Iam passionate about the process because it involves Tuberculosis cures once medication is promptly taken as presicribed</p>
            <p>Besides work, Iam passionate about watching movies,swimming and Outings and so thats how i spend my leisure</p>
